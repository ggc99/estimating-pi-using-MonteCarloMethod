# estimating-pi-using-MonteCarloMethod
This is a Python pyglet (OpenGL) project that uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of pi. The Monte Carlo method is a strategy to solve a problem using porbabilities. In this case we sue the porbability of a random point to be in the circle when a circle is fit inside the a sqaure. More on this here: https://www.101computing.net/estimating-pi-using-the-monte-carlo-method/

##Installation
In order to run, install pyglet using pip:

`pip install pyglet`

and make sure you are using python3

##Running

To run the simulation:

`python main.py`

A new window should open and the calculation should start

##Customization

In order to customize the simulation (changing window size, colors, size of circle/square) the global variables can be adjusted
